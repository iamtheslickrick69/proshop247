### Option C Selections:

- **Voice**: Twilio + Deepgram (STT) + ElevenLabs (TTS)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector for embeddings)
- **Frontend**: Lovable (landing page with dual-demo system)
- **Memory**: Store ALL conversations, retrieve last 3 for context
- **Demo System**: Custom demo generator (25 free interactions, email required)
